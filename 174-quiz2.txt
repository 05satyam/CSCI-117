question1:
given array:  10, -8, -4, 3, -2, 5, 6, -2
my asnwer to max subarray [3,-2,5,1]---> here i typed wrongly instead of 6 I typed 1 in hurry.

rest i didnt give complete explanation but able to find max subarray with appropriate logic

I would give myself 3 points for finding the max sum sub array

question 2: BUILD-MAX-HEAP

I would give 9 points as i have shown complete step with heapify implementation.

There are some typing mistakes in words other than tree build for which I deduct 1 mark

question 3
total sample space is 36
I missed one sample space of (5,1) and considered only {(1,5),(2,4),(3,3),(4,2)} because I counted (1,5) two times in hurry and hence calculated worgly

so 0 marks as 5/36 was the correct answer

question 4:

here K value is correct but I didnt write the time complexities 
I will grade 3 marks for the K value

question 5:
Not able to grade ideally I would have given 5 marks but as steps are not complete as after two steps i write down final asnwer due to times
Maam kindly grade accordingly

question 6:
i would give myself 3 as appropriate explanation is missing according to me why i choose values

quesyion 7:
not attempted so 0 marks

question 8:
9 marks  because, in second part I have calculated a* f(n/b)<= cf(n) and mentioned the condition in solution
but steps are not shown this calculation

quesstion 9:
1 mark
